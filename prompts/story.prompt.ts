  Example output:
  narrator:
  The sun rises in the valley. It is the beginning of the new spring season. [birds chirping] [trees rustling] Three pig brothers, Bartholomew, Clarence, and Frank, decide to build new homes.

  narrator:
  Bartholomew just wants to play. Clarence likes to take his time. Frank thinks carefully about everything.

  Bathelmewl:
  [southern accent] [playfully] Straw's quick, y'all! I can build this in a flash. Then I'm fixin' to nap before supper. It'll be a fine, light house!

  narrator:
  Bartholomew quickly gathers straw and ties it together. His house stands tall, but it looks a bit shaky.

  Bathelmewl:
  [southern accent] [cheerfully] I'm done. I think I'll go play in the creek now!

  narrator:
  Clarence starts on his house next.

  Clarence:
  [southern accent] [confidently] Wood's sturdier, Bart. Don't want no wind whippin' through. A good, strong frame makes a difference. This will take me a little longer.

  narrator:
  Clarence saws and hammers, putting wooden planks together. His house is strong and brown.

  Clarence:
  [sighs in accomplishment] Ahhh... What a beauty!

  narrator:
  Frank, the oldest brother, starts on his own house.

  Frank:
  [determined] [southern] Bricks are best. Strong and steady! They take the longest, but this house will last. [sighs in relief]

  narrator:
  Frank mixes mortar and lays each brick with care. His house is solid and red. Soon, all three houses are ready.

  narrator:
  A big, hungry wolf walks by. He sniffs the air and spots the piggies. He approaches the straw house

  wolf:
  [deep inhale] My, oh my. That smells good. Little pig, little pig, let me in!

  Bathelmewl:
  [scared] No, sir! Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin! You can't come in!

  wolf:
  [growls] [groans] Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down!

  narrator:
  The wolf takes a deep breath. He huffs and he puffs with all his might. The straw house shakes and then falls apart! Bartholomew screams and runs as fast as his little legs can carry him. He dashes to Clarence's wood house.

  wolf:
  [shouts] [annoyed]Two little pigs! Let me in! I know you're in there!

  Clarence:
  [firmly] Never! You won't get in here!

  narrator:
  The wolf tries again. He huffs and he puffs. The wood house creaks and groans. [wood creaking] [twigs snapping]It shakes hard, but it stays up! The wolf tries one more time, huffing even harder. [wood creaking loudly] [louder snapping]The wood house trembles, but it holds strong.

  narrator:
  Bartholomew and Clarence look at each other, worried. They know they need to get to Frank's house. They peek out the window and see the wolf still huffing. They sneak out the back door and race to Frank's brick house.

  wolf:
  [annoyed, loud] Three little pigs! Let me in! I know you're all in there now!

  Frank:
  [boldly] [defiantly] Not a chance! This house is made of bricks!

  narrator:
  The wolf is very angry now. He takes the biggest breath he can. He huffs and he puffs with all his might. He huffs and he puffs again. He pushes hard against the bricks. The brick house does not move one bit.

  narrator:
  The wolf tries and tries until he is red in the face. He is very tired. He stomps his feet and grumbles. He turns around and walks away, defeated. The three pigs cheer inside the strong brick house

  narrator: He pushes hard against the bricks. The brick house does not move one bit.

  narrator: [building to the climax] The wolf tries and tries until he is red in the face. He is very tired. He stomps his feet and grumbles. He turns around and walks away, defeated. The three pigs cheer inside the strong brick house
